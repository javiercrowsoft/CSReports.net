CSReports.net
=============

Welcome

CSReports.Net is a report editor tool that allows you to create reports from data in SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle and MySQL

The datasource can be a SQL select statement or an stored procedure. A report can contain many datasources.

It is written in C#.

It runs in Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.

It support multiple headers, footers and groups.

Sections can contain subsections.

You can create formulas to define the value of controls and the visibility of controls, sections and subsections.

Formulas can be written in C# or VB.Net

It support images embedded in the report or from the database.

In a future version it will allow to preview reports in the browser using the canvas object for rendering.

It can export to PDF and Excel.

The datasource can be a JSON file so it can run disconnected from a database as a client preview tool that consume
reports from a web application.

All the controls in the report can be browsed and linked to other reports or web pages.

It is open source and all the code is in Github.

I am working a version that can preview reports in mobile devices using Xamarin.
